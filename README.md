# YIC-Project

This was a project developed over my Year in Computing at The University of Kent.

The goal was to create a simple educational physics website. 

Currently public for purposes of submission to ELVTR DSIF.

Ultimately, my'final' branch is, you guessed it, the final branch. I just didn't want to merge/pull request into main because I wanted to leave it as it was submitted at the time, without risking anything.

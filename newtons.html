		<p>Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. Newton's first law is also known as the law of inertia, which states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Newton's second law is also known as the law of acceleration, which states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and occurs in the same direction as the applied force. Newton's third law is also known as the law of action and reaction, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
